Basic Analysis:
Based on the funnel there seems to be strong engagement between getting to the home page and reading an article. However roughly a third of readers do not create an account. There seems to be friction in the sign up process, lets identify this and maybe a lack of value proposed prior to sign up, User Interface issues, etc.
Secondly it is important to note that The biggest drop is in geting users to buy but I think that starting with increasing that mid-funnel success from account creation to free trial will in turn create more volume of subscribers initially then focus on free-trial to subscribe friction.
